          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Navsanjeevan Social Trust (NST) is dedicated to empowering
            marginalized communities in India. We achieve this by providing
            access to quality education, vital skills training, and creating
            opportunities for sustainable livelihoods. Recognizing the disparity
            between rural and urban populations, NST strives to bridge this gap
            by ensuring everyone has access to the resources they need to
            thrive. Ultimately, our mission is to foster a society built on
            inclusivity and sustainability, where every individual has the
            chance to reach their full potential.

          The Navsanjeevan Social Trust works to empower individuals and
          communities in Pune and surrounding districts. Through the Youth Skill
          Development program, they equip students with market-ready skills by
          offering Pre-vocational Education (6th-8th Std) and Multi Skill
          Foundation courses (9th-12th Std) that emphasize employability skills
          through internships. Additionally, vocational training programs cater
          specifically to agricultural trades, ensuring a skilled workforce
          prepared for local job market needs. Career guidance and counseling
          are provided in 5 schools, supporting students in 10th and 12th grades
          as they make informed decisions about their futures. The Scholarship
          Program tackles educational barriers by providing financial aid for
          technical education to underprivileged individuals, aiming to increase
          the number of skilled professionals. Beyond schools, the Trust's Women
          Empowerment initiatives empower women in 51 villages through self-help
          group formation, training programs reaching 3,000 women, and a strong
          focus on promoting gender equality and improving livelihoods. Their
          dedication to sustainable practices extends to agriculture as well,
          with training programs equipping 300 small farmers with modern
          techniques. Finally, their community development efforts prioritize
          the well-being of residents, exemplified by establishing an RO water
          treatment plant that benefits over 2,700 families in the Kolhapur
          district.
